# Unconventional-Signal-Denoising

### Short Description of Repository
This Repo contain files and MATLAB code for Unconventional-Signal-Denoising. 


### References: 

  1. The main denoising code is modified version of Asraf's version here:

  4. The Complete ECG data (noisy and clean) is taken from Physionet's ECG Database here: 
  https://archive.physionet.org/cgi-bin/atm/ATM


  5. When you open above link, please specify the following:
    - Database : ECG-ID Database (ecgiddb)
    - Record: Person_02/rec_19
    - Signals : ECG I or ECG I Filtered
    - Length,Time Format, Data Format : leave it as it is
    - Toolbox : Export signals as CSV


   6. Then you can click sample.csv to download the data.


   7. Use matlab R2015A or above
